For each command, a Redis server sends a response back to the client.\nCommands and responses are both encoded using the [Redis protocol](https://redis.io/topics/protocol) (we'll learn more about this in later stages).\n\n[PING](https://redis.io/commands/ping/) is one of the simplest Redis commands.

This is the string \"PONG\" encoded using the [Redis protocol](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/).\n\nIn this stage, we'll cut corners by ignoring client input and hardcoding `+PONG\\r\\n` as a response.

      "description_md": "Congratulations on reaching the final stage of the Redis replication challenge! By now, you should have a Redis master instance and at least one replica configured.\nIn this stage you'll aim to ensure your replication setup is robust, data between the master and replicas remain consistent, and your system can handle multiple replicas.\n\n### Tests\n\nThe tester will execute your program like this:\n(The spawn_redis.sh is not your implementation of Redis.)\n\n```\n./spawn_redis_server.sh --port <PORT>\n./spawn_redis.sh --replicaof localhost:6379 --port 6380\n./spawn_redis.sh --replicaof localhost:6379 --port 6381\n./spawn_redis.sh --replicaof localhost:6379 --port 6382\n```\n\nThe master should finish the handshake with all the replicas. (PING, REPLCONF, PSYNC)\nIt'll then send `SET` commands to the master from a client.\n\n```bash\n$ redis-cli SET mykey \"Hello\"\n```\n\nIt'll then expect the commands to be propagated to all the replicas, and the replicas to parse them, and apply them against its DB.\nIt will send `GET` requests to the replicas from another client.\n\n```bash\n$ redis-cli GET myKey\n```\n\nIt'll expect to receive the correct values as sent to the Master.\n",
