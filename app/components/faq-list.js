      answer: "We understand that students may be on a tight budget. Our primary target customers are professionals who are short on time and value a well-organised, high-quality learning experience. We encourage students that have time on their side, to try out free resources such as books, tutorials, and videos. You can always join CodeCrafters later when you're ready.",
