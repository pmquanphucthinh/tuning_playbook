        Congratulations are in order. Only ~{{@repository.course.roundedCompletionPercentage}}% of users that attempt this challenge end up completing
        all stages, and you're one of them!
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's what you can do next:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Polish your code. </strong>Perhaps you took a shortcut when approaching the challenge the first time. Now is a great time to clean
          up your code. You can simply push new commits to the existing repo, and we'll run tests just like before.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Publish to GitHub. </strong>Share your work with the world. With one click, you can publish your CodeCrafters project to GitHub.
          <span role="button" class="underline" {{on "click" @onPublishToGithubClick}}><strong>Click here</strong></span>
          to get started.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Try a different approach. </strong>You can re-approach the same challenge with a new programming language, a new constraint, or a
          new style. To launch the challenge again, click the Project Options dropdown on the top right.
        </li>
      </ul>
